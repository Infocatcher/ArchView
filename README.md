This is a fork of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/archview/">ArchView</a> extension by <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/user/153702/">solar</a>.
<br>Updated for Firefox 4 and higher.
<br>But for now I don't have plans (and time) to support extension, sorry. I just tried to fix it and some features seems works for me, so I released this updated version.
<br>Feel free to fork it!

#### Usage:
Just run <a href="make.bat">make.bat</a> (<a href="http://7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> required) or pack all files into ZIP-archive:
```
